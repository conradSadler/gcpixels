## Overview

This application is for pixel artists who want to collaboratively and individually create pixel art. If you venture within you will find a blank canvas full of possibilities. 
Expand those possibilities by making a shared canvas where your friends can join with the shared_code for an endless amount of coloring posibilities.

To use this application, simply create an account and start coloring.
